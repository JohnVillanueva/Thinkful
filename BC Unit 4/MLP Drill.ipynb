Feel free to interrupt the kernel if you don't have time...\n",

    "Now, before we move on and let you loose with some tasks to work on the model, let's go over the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "We included one parameter: hidden layer size. Remember in the previous lesson, when we talked about layers in a neural network. This tells us how many and how big to make our layers. Pass in a tuple that specifies each layer's size. Our network is 1000 neurons wide and one layer. (100, 4, ) would create a network with two layers, one 100 wide and the other 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many layers to include is determined by two things: computational resources and cross validation searching for convergence. It's generally less than the number of input variables you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also set an alpha. Neural networks like this use a regularization parameter that penalizes large coefficients just like we discussed in the advanced regression section. Alpha scales that penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, we'll discuss the activation function. The activation function determines whether the output from an individual perceptron is binary or continuous. By default this is a 'relu', or 'rectified linear unit function' function. In the exercise we went through earlier we used this binary function, but we discussed the _sigmoid_ as a reasonable alternative. The _sigmoid_ (called 'logistic' by SKLearn because it's a 'logistic sigmoid function') allows for continuous variables between 0 and 1, which allows for a more nuanced model. It does come at the cost of increased computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about these, study [activation functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_function) and [multilayer perceptrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron). The [Deep Learning](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/) book referenced earlier goes into great detail on the linear algebra involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could also just test the models with cross validation. Unless neural networks are your specialty cross validation should be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the other parameters and their defaults, check out the [MLPClassifier documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier.html#sklearn.neural_network.MLPClassifier)."
